AutoTune is a simple program that automatically tags music based on information from the iTunes Affiliates API so that you can enjoy the benefits of a well-organized music library. AutoTune can tag a variety of music regardless where it is purchased from (Google Play Store, Ripped CDs etc.). AutoTune adds essential music information, as well as obscure info such as Track ID, Artist ID, and Genre ID, directly from iTunes thus providing a plethora of benefits such as artist profile pictures in iTunes, Apple Music lyrics, if a subscription is present.
